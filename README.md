Clicking on any of the items in the Placemark Editor Screen will provide you with the ability to edit those fields. By Default, placemarks have Name, Description Photo and Location fields you can populate with the values you need. If you find that you would like to add more fields, you can create a custom schema using the tools at the bottom of the Placemark Editor Screen. For this exercise, it will not be necessary to do so, but you are free to experiment.

###Adding Photos to a Placemark

Clicking on the Photos Item in the Placemark Editor will bring a screen that allows you to select an existing photo, or use the device camera to take a new one. Note that you are able to attach multiple photos to each Placemark. As a best practice, it is a good idea to go into the camera settings on your device to set the photos to a low or medium resolution (whichever is sufficient for your purpose), in order to economize on the size of your Placemark Collections.

### Exporting a Collection of Placemarks

There are a great number of options for exporting your placemarks, in terms of format, method, etc... Here, you are provide with the most expedient method, that preserves the photos embedded in your placemark collection.
